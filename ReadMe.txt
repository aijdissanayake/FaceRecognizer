* This application is face recognition bio-metric authentication system.

* At the start of the app matching value(0-100) has to be entered.

* This matching value decides how close the faces should hen authenticating

* According to the algorithm used 0 - will authenticate with any face image 
whereas 100 will authenticate only the exact face image used for registering.

* Face detection is based in colour distribution of the image which is based on the resarch paper
found at http://cat.hfu.edu.tw/~b8403009/TD-006386.pdf

* All the stored images of registered users are encrypted and saved considering the security reasons. 
(For evaluation purposes, hen authnticating two images compared are saved to the project folder as;
user given input image:'userInput.png' and registered image : 'stored.png')

* To use the app 200X280 size images should be used

* Face recogntion has to be optimized

* Images with faces that covering almost the image with natural colours would be ideal

* few Sample images are store in the projects sampleImages Folder
